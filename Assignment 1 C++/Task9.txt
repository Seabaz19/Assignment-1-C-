What did you learn? What did you know already?

I learned to use visual studio, github and simple syntax of C++.
I already knew how to do the most of the tasks in theory as I had to do similar tasks in python last learning period.

What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?

I found it difficult to complete task 8 especially as using ASCII was new to me but through research adn discussing it with my peers, 
I was able to figure out how to use it effectively to acheive the desired goal of a pyramid for task 8.
